crbehave
========

crbehave is a behavior driven development framework for C that uses
standard regular expressions for matching, instead of a specialized
system, and instead of relying on macros.

The crbehave reads a specification of scenarios following the Gherkin
given-when-then syntax and calls the respective functions for making the
specification executable.

The scenarios are tested in separate worker processes for making sure
complete feature specifications are executed without unnecessary delays,
even if there are crashes or slow test code.

It was originally written by the author after opening the first pages of
Jamis Buck's excellent book, the "The Ray Tracer Challenge - A
Test-Driven Guide to Your First 3D Renderer", after finding, at that
time, there was no adequate behavior driven development framework for C
that would satisfy the author's taste.

C compiler and standard headers installed.
